# JavaScript - Web jQuery

`jQuery` - jQuery is a javascript library that helps developers write javascript code more syntatically easily. When combined with ajax, jQuery also helps us update the our website dynamically. In earlier day (i.e during the browser war in the 1990s), jQuery was used to write code that works on all browsers, thus ensuring compatibility. Even today, jQuery let's us write javascript code (such as updating the dom and making ajax request) less verbose compared to vannila javascript.
